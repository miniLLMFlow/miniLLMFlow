# Agent

For many tasks, we need agents that take dynamic and recursive actions based on the inputs they receive.
You can create these agents as **Nodes** connected by *Actions* in a directed graph using [Flow](./flow.md).


### Example: Search Agent

This agent:
1. Decides whether to search or answer
2. If searches, loops back to decide if more search needed
3. Answers when enough context gathered

```python
class DecideAction(Node):
    def prep(self, shared):
        context = shared.get("context", "No previous search")
        query = shared["query"]
        return query, context
        
    def exec(self, inputs):
        query, context = inputs
        prompt = f"""
Given input: {query}
Previous search results: {context}
Should I: 1) Search web for more info 2) Answer with current knowledge
Output in yaml:
```yaml
action: search/answer
reason: why this action
search_term: search phrase if action is search
```"""
        resp = call_llm(prompt)
        yaml_str = resp.split("```yaml")[1].split("```")[0].strip()
        result = yaml.safe_load(yaml_str)
        
        assert isinstance(result, dict)
        assert "action" in result
        assert "reason" in result
        assert result["action"] in ["search", "answer"]
        if result["action"] == "search":
            assert "search_term" in result
        
        return result

    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
        if exec_res["action"] == "search":
            shared["search_term"] = exec_res["search_term"]
        return exec_res["action"]

class SearchWeb(Node):
    def prep(self, shared):
        return shared["search_term"]
        
    def exec(self, search_term):
        return search_web(search_term)
    
    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
        prev_searches = shared.get("context", [])
        shared["context"] = prev_searches + [
            {"term": shared["search_term"], "result": exec_res}
        ]
        return "decide"
        
class DirectAnswer(Node):
    def prep(self, shared):
        return shared["query"], shared.get("context", "")
        
    def exec(self, inputs):
        query, context = inputs
        return call_llm(f"Context: {context}\nAnswer: {query}")

# Connect nodes
decide = DecideAction()
search = SearchWeb()
answer = DirectAnswer()

decide - "search" >> search
decide - "answer" >> answer
search - "decide" >> decide  # Loop back

flow = Flow(start=decide)
flow.run({"query": "Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics 2024?"})
```
